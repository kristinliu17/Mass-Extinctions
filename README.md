This model covers mass extinctions. In this module we will be looking at the current rate of extinction for a variety of species and compare them to a background rate. We will recreate a graph of cumulative extinctions as % of IUCN evaluated species over time to show the acceleration of the pace of extinction. We will also analyze the implications of this biodiversity loss and whether a 6th mass extinction is approaching.

## assignment

All work for this assignment should be in the `assignment` directory.  You will work in the `.Rmd` notebook, and commit your rendered output files (`.md` and associated files) in the `assignment` directory as well.

## Special files

All team repositories will also include most of the special files found here:

### Common files

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` Optional, an R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration.  Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file.


### Infrastructure for Testing

- `DESCRIPTION` a metadata file for the repository, based on the R package standard. It's main purpose here is as a place to list any additional R packages/libraries needed for any of the `.Rmd` files to run.
