## Extinctions Module

_Are we experiencing the sixth great extinction?_  

What is the current pace of extinction? Is it accelerating? How does it compare to background extinction rates?

The current pace of extinction is vastly accelerating. Even under extremely conservative assumptions, with a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (2 E/MSY) which is two times higher than previous estimates, we can see that the mean rate of vertabrate loss that has been seen in the past century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the assumptions of the 2 E/MSY rate, the amount that disappeared in the last 100 years would have taken 800 to 10,000 years to become extinct. This is showing how the pace of extinction is accelerating over time. It also serves to show how we are rapidly lowering th biodiversity on the planet and are hurtling toward the 6th great extinction.

## Background

- [Section Intro Video](https://youtu.be/QsH6ytm89GI)
- [Ceballos et al (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400253)

Our focal task will be to reproduce the result from Ceballos and colleagues showing the recent increase in extinction rates relative to the background rate:

## Code for extracting species and extinct data

#### Species List 
```{r}
base <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/species/"
page <- "page/"
page_number <- 0:14
query <- "?token="
token <- "9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
  
urls <- paste0(base, page, page_number, query, token)

if(!file.exists("species_request.rds")){
  species_request <- map(urls, GET)
  saveRDS(species_request, "species_request.rds")
}

species_request <- readRDS("species_request.rds")
```

```{r}
contents <- map(species_request, content, as = "text")
species <- map(contents, fromJSON)
species_df <- map_dfr(species, "result")
```

#### Finding total number of species in each class from original data.
```{r}
total_class_count <- species_df %>% 
  count(class_name) %>%
  rename(total_count = n)
head(total_class_count)
```

#### Filtering by extinct species and then class, finding percentage of extinction
```{r}
extinct <- filter(species_df, category == "EX")

extinct_count <- extinct %>% 
  count(class_name) %>%
  rename(extinct_species = n) %>%
  left_join(total_class_count, by = "class_name")

percentage_extinction <- extinct_count %>%
  mutate(percentage_extinct = extinct_species / total_count)
head(percentage_extinction)
```

#### Finding year of extinction for each species.
```{r}
base <- "https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/species/narrative/"
sci_name <- extinct$scientific_name
token <- "?token=9bb4facb6d23f48efbf424bb05c0c1ef1cf6f468393bc745d42179ac4aca5fee"
url <- paste0(base, sci_name, token)

if(!file.exists("year_extinct_request.rds")){
  year_extinct_request <- map(url, GET)
  saveRDS(year_extinct_request, "year_extinct_request.rds")
}

year_extinct_request <- readRDS("year_extinct_request.rds")
```

```{r}
text_year_extinct <- map(year_extinct_request, content, as = "text")
json <- map_dfr(text_year_extinct, fromJSON)
txt <- json$result$rational

extract_last_year <- function(txt){
  all_years <- str_extract_all(txt, "\\d{4}")
  map_dbl(all_years, ~ max(as.integer(.)))
}

head(extract_last_year(txt))

last_year_data <- json$result %>% 
  mutate(last_year = extract_last_year(rationale)) %>%
  left_join(extinct, by = c("species_id" = "taxonid")) %>%
  select(species_id, last_year, kingdom_name, phylum_name, class_name, order_name, family_name, genus_name, scientific_name,
         category, main_common_name)
head(last_year_data)
```

## Arranging by class and calculating percentage of extinction
```{r}
mammals <- last_year_data %>%
  filter(class_name == "MAMMALIA") %>%
  arrange(last_year) %>%
  left_join(percentage_extinction, by = "class_name") %>%
  mutate(number = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage_extinct =  number / total_count)
birds <- last_year_data %>%
  filter(class_name == "AVES") %>%
  arrange(last_year) %>%
  left_join(percentage_extinction, by = "class_name") %>%
  mutate(number = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage_extinct =  number / total_count)
amphibians <- last_year_data %>%
  filter(class_name == "AMPHIBIA") %>%
  arrange(last_year) %>%
  left_join(percentage_extinction, by = "class_name") %>%
  mutate(number = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage_extinct =  number / total_count)
reptiles <- last_year_data %>%
  filter(class_name == "REPTILIA") %>%
  arrange(last_year) %>%
  left_join(percentage_extinction, by = "class_name") %>%
  mutate(number = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage_extinct =  number / total_count)
vertebrates_extinct <- last_year_data %>% 
  filter(class_name %in% c("MAMMALIA", "ACTINOPTERYGII", "AMPHIBIA", "REPTILIA", 
                           "AVES")) %>%
  arrange(last_year) %>%
  left_join(percentage_extinction, by = "class_name") %>%
  mutate(number = row_number()) %>%
  mutate(total_vertebrates = 55166) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_percentage_extinct =  number / total_vertebrates)
```

## Graphing extinction plot
```{r}
colors <- c("mammals" = "blue", "birds" = "red", "amphibians" = "green", "reptiles" = "purple", "vertebrates" = "orange",
            "background rate" = "black")

extinction_graph <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = mammals, aes(x = last_year, y = cumulative_percentage_extinct*100, color = "mammals")) +
  geom_line(data = birds, aes(x = last_year, y = cumulative_percentage_extinct*100, color = "birds")) +

  labs(title = "Cumulative vertebrate species recorded as extinct by the IUCN", x = "Year of extinction", 
       y = "Cumulative exctinctions as % of IUCN-evaluated species") +
  labs(colour = "Class") +

## Analysis of data and graph
#### Explanation of our graph and data versus graph and qualitative conclusions of Cerbellos

As you can see through this graph we attempted to recreate the graph from Cerbellos et al. titled “Accelerated modern human–induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction.” In the graph we made, there are some distinct changes from the initial graph. Instead of the categories of vertebrates, mammals, other vertebrates, and birds, we used the categories of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and vertebrates. In terms of organization, we felt it was much more readable and relevant to sort by classes in the vertebrate category and then an overall vertebrate line. We also did not bin our data because we only use four digit numeric numbers for the dates for the x-axis. If our team had additional time to work more in depth on the project we would have spent time using regular expressions to extract other dates front the rationale that were not 4 digit numerics, like “18th century”, we would have binned the data for our graph. The binning is also why our lines look so different as we mapped out the lines by year rather than decade.  

#### Overal analysis of extinction graph

Overall our graph shows very similar results to Cerbellos et al. We can see in our graph that the rate of extinction among all the different classes of animals is higher than our background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years as well as an increase in the rate of extinction over time. All this points to a 6th mass extinction in the works. As Barnosky et al. (2011) states, all of the previous big 5 extinctions have had key synergies that may involve unusual climate dynamics, atmospheric composition and abnormally high-intensity ecological stressors that negatively affect many different lineages. These are changes we are seeing today in our world through the impacts of climate change and pollution as atmospheric conditions change, CO2 levels rise, and the human population expands. As Pimm et al (2014) states, the overarching driver of species extinction is human population growth and increasing per capita consumption. The only way to save the future of our plant as we know it is for us to find solutions to the overpopulation and overconsumption problem humans on earth are facing.
